The sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows across the quiet field.
A gentle breeze stirred the tall grass, whispering secrets only the earth could understand.

In the distance, a lone figure walked slowly, hands buried deep in coat pockets.
Each step seemed deliberate, as if the ground itself demanded respect.

Birds circled overhead, their calls echoing like memories half-remembered.
Somewhere, a clock chimed the hour-once, twice-then silence returned.

The old house at the edge of town still stood, though its windows were long shattered.
Children spoke of it in hushed tones, claiming they heard voices at night.
No one ever proved them wrong.
